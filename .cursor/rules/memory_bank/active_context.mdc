# Active Context — Burooj Corporate Website

## Current Focus (2025-12-02)
1. **Foundation completed:** Nuxt 3 project scaffolded with Tailwind, GSAP plugin, default layout, and top-level pages.
2. **Next Implementation Step:** Flesh out component library (BaseButton, SectionWrapper, StatsGrid, etc.) and begin detailed Home/About/Services content polish.
3. **Validation:** Maintain build success (`npm run build`) and monitor Node engine warnings until environment upgrades to ≥20.19.

## Pending Decisions / Questions
- Confirm preferred package manager (npm vs pnpm) before initializing project.
- Determine whether to start with SSG (`nuxt generate`) or SSR deployment target.
- Clarify hosting provider (Vercel vs alternative) for environment-specific configs.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Implement reusable base components (buttons, wrappers, grids) to reduce duplication in pages.
2. Wire GSAP composable into sections with ScrollTrigger hooks.
3. Expand Services/Projects data configs for future CMS integration.

## Risks / Watch Items
- Animation performance: ensure ScrollTrigger instances cleaned up and reduced-motion respected.
- Form validation scope: confirm acceptable file types/sizes for uploads before wiring UI.
- Content updates: keep copy source-of-truth in project description; sync before edits.
