# Active Context — Burooj Corporate Website

## Current Focus (2026-02-01)
1. **UI polish & responsiveness:** Ongoing responsive layout pass across pages (Home/About/Services/Projects).
2. **Next Implementation Step:** Continue consolidating repeated UI into reusable components (buttons, wrappers, grids) and finish content polish.
3. **Validation:** Keep `npm run build` green after layout/animation changes; watch animation performance and reduced-motion behavior.

## Pending Decisions / Questions
- Confirm preferred package manager (npm vs pnpm) before initializing project.
- Determine whether to start with SSG (`nuxt generate`) or SSR deployment target.
- Clarify hosting provider (Vercel vs alternative) for environment-specific configs.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Implement reusable base components (buttons, wrappers, grids) to reduce duplication in pages.
2. Wire GSAP composable into sections with ScrollTrigger hooks.
3. Expand Services/Projects data configs for future CMS integration.

## Recently Completed
- Responsive polish: projects grid uses 3 columns on large screens; project detail “label/value” rows stack on small screens.
- About page BTS gallery: unified card sizing across all repeated image sets.
- Sticky headings: enabled only on `md+` where layouts are two-column to avoid overlap on mobile.
- Projects structure hardening: filters use stable keys (not translated text), added Property Management filter, fixed `baseURL` image path joining, prevented duplicate GSAP section refs, and standardized full-width image aspect ratio.
- Project detail gallery layout updated: first 2 images stay in 2-column grid, next 3 show as 1 full-width + 2 below, plus an additional story paragraph block.
- Added new project entry: “Al-Fakhreyah Villa Project” (placeholder images ready to replace when assets are provided).
- Updated “Private Shalet” project to “Halfmoon Villa” and wired images from `public/images/projects/4/`.
- Updated “GDC” project to “Co-working Space” and wired images from `public/images/projects/5/`.
- Updated “Efficiency Center Khobar branch” project to “GDC” and wired images from `public/images/projects/6/`.
- Updated “Tulip Spa” project to use images from `public/images/projects/7/`.
- Updated “Thabat” project to “Thabat Booth” and wired images from `public/images/projects/8/`.
- Updated “Roaya” project to use images from `public/images/projects/9/`.
- Dev server reliability: fixed Nuxt/Vite dev crash caused by unresolved `#app-manifest` and aligned local dev port to 3001.

## Risks / Watch Items
- Animation performance: ensure ScrollTrigger instances cleaned up and reduced-motion respected.
- Form validation scope: confirm acceptable file types/sizes for uploads before wiring UI.
- Content updates: keep copy source-of-truth in project description; sync before edits.
