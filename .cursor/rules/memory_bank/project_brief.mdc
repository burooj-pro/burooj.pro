# Project Brief — Burooj Corporate Website

## Objective
- Build a premium, multi-page corporate website for Burooj, highlighting its construction, property management, and drone-cleaning divisions.
- Deliver a fast, accessible, animation-enhanced experience that showcases services, projects, and contact funnels for Saudi-based corporate clients.

## Key Deliverables
1. Fully responsive Nuxt 3 site with pages for Home, About, Services, Projects, and Contact.
2. Reusable component system (buttons, sections, stats, services, projects, clients, forms).
3. GSAP-powered hero, scroll-trigger, and counter animations respecting performance budgets.
4. Validated contact form ready for API integration (client-side validation + file upload).
5. SEO, accessibility, and performance optimizations aligned with Lighthouse 90+ targets.

## Success Criteria
- Accurate implementation of the provided content/branding copy.
- Consistent design system (colors, typography, spacing).
- Smooth animations that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, semantic HTML, structured data.
- Deployable build (SSG/SSR) with clear path for future Arabic support.

## Constraints & Policies
- No internal Burooj Air microsite; all CTAs open `https://buroojair.com` in a new tab.
- Avoid lorem ipsum; use supplied text blocks.
- Prefer Tailwind CSS utilities; keep code extensible for CMS/i18n future phases.
- Follow Memory Bank workflow for planning, execution, validation, documentation.

## Stakeholders & Audience
- Internal: Burooj leadership, marketing, engineering partners.
- External: Saudi corporate clients, developers, investors, property owners seeking integrated services.

## Current Phase
- Documentation & planning complete (project description + memory bank kickoff).
- Next step: scaffold Nuxt 3 app and begin implementing layout/components per specs.
