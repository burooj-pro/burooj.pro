# Burooj Corporate Website - Project Description

## Project Overview

You are building a modern corporate website for a Saudi company called "Burooj" - a multi-disciplinary company offering comprehensive solutions across engineering, construction, property management, and drone cleaning services.

---

## Technology Stack & Setup

### Core Framework
- **Framework:** Nuxt 3 (latest stable version)
- **Language:** Vue 3 with Composition API (`<script setup>`)
- **TypeScript:** Recommended for type safety (optional but preferred)
- **Node Version:** Node.js 18+ (LTS)

### Styling
- **Primary:** Tailwind CSS with custom configuration

### Animations
- **Library:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
- **Plugins:** 
  - `gsap/ScrollTrigger` for scroll-based animations
  - `gsap/TextPlugin` if needed for text animations
- **Performance:** Use `will-change` CSS property sparingly, prefer GPU-accelerated transforms

### Build & Development
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **Development Server:** Nuxt dev server with HMR
- **Build:** Static site generation (SSG) or SSR as needed
- **Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier configured

---

## Brand & Design System

### Brand Identity
- **Brand:** Modern, professional, tech-driven
- **Sector:** Construction & Engineering, Property Management, Drone Cleaning (Burooj Air)
- **Tone:** Premium but clean, with subtle motion (not overwhelming animations)
- **Target Audience:** Corporate clients, developers, investors, property owners in Saudi Arabia

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Primary Accent: Choose one strong corporate color (e.g., deep blue #003366, or teal #006B7D)
- Background: Neutral light base (#FFFFFF, #FAFAFA, #F5F5F5)
- Text Primary: Dark gray/black (#1A1A1A, #2D2D2D)
- Text Secondary: Medium gray (#666666, #808080)

**Semantic Colors:**
- Success: Green (#10B981 or similar)
- Error/Warning: Red/Orange (#EF4444 or similar)
- Info: Blue (#3B82F6 or similar)

**Recommendation:** Define a complete palette in `tailwind.config.js` or CSS variables for consistency.

### Typography
- **Primary Font:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or system font stack)
- **Headings:** Bold, clear hierarchy (H1: 2.5-3rem, H2: 2rem, H3: 1.5rem on desktop)
- **Body:** 16px base, line-height 1.6-1.8
- **Responsive:** Scale down proportionally on mobile (use `clamp()` or Tailwind responsive classes)

### Spacing & Layout
- **Container Max Width:** 1280px (or 1200px) for main content
- **Section Padding:** Consistent vertical spacing (e.g., py-16 md:py-24)
- **Grid System:** CSS Grid or Flexbox with Tailwind utilities
- **Breakpoints:** 
  - Mobile: < 640px
  - Tablet: 640px - 1024px
  - Desktop: > 1024px
  - Large Desktop: > 1280px

### Animation Guidelines
- **Duration:** 300-600ms for most transitions
- **Easing:** `ease-out` or custom cubic-bezier for natural feel
- **Scroll Animations:** Trigger when element is 20-30% visible in viewport
- **Performance:** Use `transform` and `opacity` only (avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`)
- **Reduced Motion:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

---

## GSAP Implementation Details

### Installation
```bash
npm install gsap
```

### Setup
- Create `composables/useGsap.ts` or `plugins/gsap.client.ts`
- Register GSAP plugins (ScrollTrigger) in Nuxt plugin
- Create reusable animation utilities

### Animation Patterns

**1. ScrollTrigger Setup:**
```javascript
import { gsap } from 'gsap'
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger'

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)
```

**2. Fade-in on Scroll:**
```javascript
gsap.from('.element', {
  opacity: 0,
  y: 30,
  duration: 0.8,
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: '.element',
    start: 'top 80%',
    toggleActions: 'play none none none'
  }
})
```

**3. Counter Animation:**
```javascript
gsap.to('.counter', {
  innerHTML: targetValue,
  duration: 2,
  ease: 'power2.out',
  snap: { innerHTML: 1 },
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: '.counter',
    start: 'top 80%',
    once: true
  }
})
```

**4. Stagger Animation:**
```javascript
gsap.from('.card', {
  opacity: 0,
  y: 30,
  duration: 0.6,
  stagger: 0.1,
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: '.container',
    start: 'top 80%'
  }
})
```

### Performance Considerations

- Use `will-change` sparingly (only during animation)
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity` (GPU-accelerated)
- Use `once: true` in ScrollTrigger to prevent re-triggering
- Clean up ScrollTrigger instances on component unmount
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:
```javascript
const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')
if (prefersReducedMotion.matches) {
  // Skip animations or use minimal animations
}
```

### Composable Pattern

Create `composables/useGsap.ts`:
```typescript
export const useGsap = () => {
  const fadeInUp = (element: string | Element, options = {}) => {
    // Reusable fade-in-up animation
  }
  
  const counterAnimation = (element: string | Element, target: number) => {
    // Reusable counter animation
  }
  
  return { fadeInUp, counterAnimation }
}
```

   - Alt text for images
   - Form labels associated with inputs
   - Error messages associated with form fields

3. **Color Contrast:**
   - Text contrast ratio: 4.5:1 (normal text), 3:1 (large text)
   - Interactive elements: 3:1 contrast

4. **Focus Management:**
   - Skip to main content link
   - Focus trap in modals/menus
   - Focus visible on all interactive elements

5. **Reduced Motion:**
   - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
   - Provide alternative for motion-heavy content

6. **Semantic HTML:**
   - Use proper HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.)
   - Proper heading hierarchy

7. **Form Accessibility:**
   - Required field indicators
   - Error messages with `aria-describedby`
   - `aria-invalid` for invalid fields
   - Form validation announcements

## Internationalization (i18n) Considerations

### Future Arabic Support

- Structure code to support RTL (Right-to-Left) layout
- Use CSS logical properties (`margin-inline-start` instead of `margin-left`)
- Consider Nuxt i18n module for future implementation
- Keep text content separate from components (use composables or constants)
- Design with RTL in mind (symmetric layouts, mirrored icons)

### Current Implementation

- English-only for now
- Structure allows easy addition of Arabic later
- Use Nuxt i18n module when ready (optional for now)

## Form Validation & Error Handling

### Contact Form Validation

**Client-Side Validation Rules:**

1. **Full Name:**
   - Required
   - Min length: 2 characters
   - Max length: 100 characters
   - Pattern: Letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes only

2. **Email:**
   - Required
   - Valid email format (regex: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`)
   - Max length: 254 characters

3. **Phone Number:**
   - Required
   - Format: Saudi format (`+966XXXXXXXXX` or `05XXXXXXXX`)
   - Regex: `/^(\+966|0)?5\d{8}$/` or similar

4. **Service Required:**
   - Required
   - Must be one of the dropdown options

5. **Message:**
   - Required
   - Min length: 10 characters
   - Max length: 2000 characters

6. **File Upload:**
   - Optional
   - Allowed types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG
   - Max file size: 5MB per file
   - Max total files: 5 (if multiple uploads)

### Error Handling

**Form Errors:**
- Display inline error messages below each field
- Use red color for errors
- Clear errors when user starts typing (for that field)
- Disable submit button if form is invalid

**Submission Errors:**
- Display error message at top of form if submission fails
- Retry mechanism (optional)
- Log errors to console (for debugging)

**Success State:**
- Display success message
- Clear form (optional)
- Redirect to thank you page (optional, future)

### Validation Library

- Use Vue 3 reactive forms
- Consider `vee-validate` or `yup` for complex validation (optional)
- Or implement custom validation functions

---

## State Management

### Simple State (No Pinia/Vuex Needed Initially)

- Use Vue 3 `ref` and `reactive` for component state
- Use composables for shared state (e.g., `useForm`, `useNavigation`)
- Props and emits for parent-child communication

### Future Considerations

- If state becomes complex, consider Pinia
- For form state, consider form libraries
- For global UI state (modals, notifications), use composables or Pinia

---

## Testing Considerations

### Testing Strategy (Future)

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Component tests (Vitest + Vue Test Utils)
   - Utility function tests

2. **E2E Tests:**
   - Playwright or Cypress
   - Critical user flows (form submission, navigation)

3. **Visual Regression:**
   - Optional: Chromatic or Percy

### Current Implementation

- Manual testing during development
- Browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device testing (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Accessibility testing (WAVE, axe DevTools)

---

## Deployment Considerations

### Build Configuration

- Static site generation (SSG) recommended for performance
- Or SSR if dynamic content needed
- Configure in `nuxt.config.ts`

### Environment Variables

- Use `.env` files for configuration
- API endpoints (when backend is ready)
- Contact form endpoint
- Analytics IDs (Google Analytics, etc.)

### Hosting Options

- Vercel (recommended for Nuxt)
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- Traditional hosting with Node.js
